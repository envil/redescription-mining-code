Three tabs contain lists of redescriptions. 

* The **Redescriptions** tab is the main list of redescriptions. Redescriptions are imported and exported to and from that list.
* The **Expansions** tab lists redescriptions that have been generated by mining or extending queries.
* The **History** tab lists all edits made to queries, allowing to undo changes.

Tabs can be shown or hidden via the interface menu :menuselection:`Windows --> Tabs`.

The main means to manipulate variables or redescriptions, depending on which tab you are currently viewing, are available via the ``Edit`` menu and the contextual menu opened by right click. 

List items can be enabled/disabled by checking/unchecking the corresponding box in the left column. All items in a list can be enabled/disabled simultaneously.
Lists can be sorted based on the value of the different fields displayed by clicking on the column header.

Redescriptions can be cut, copied, and pasted from and to different positions in the lists and from one list to the other and vice-versa.
All disabled redescriptions can be deleted at once.

.. _view_window: 

View window
--------------

A **view** window allows to visualize a redescription, to edit it and launch mining and expansion.
Several views of different types of the same redescription can be opened simultaneously. They are linked together an to the original redescription in the list so that edits and selections made in one view are reflected in the list and other views.

A ``View`` window can be opened with a double click on a variable or redescription in a list from the ``Tools`` window.

Both queries can be edited using the text boxes. If the :ref:`syntax of a query <queries>` is incorrect, *Siren* will not be able to parse it and it will fall back on the previous correct query.
Queries are parsed when ``ENTER`` is pressed, in order to avoid parsing error due to partial edits. 

:ref:`Redescriptions statistics <statistics>` are shown below the queries. 

In case of projections, setting controls allow to set parameters and the data can be projected anew by clicking the ``Reproject`` button.

Sliders allow to set the opacity of disabled entities, as well as the level of details for parallel coordinates plots.

Expansion can be started by pressing the ``Expand`` button. The expansion will be delegated to a background process. It can be interrupted via the menu :menuselection:`Process --> Stop expander XXX`, where running task are listed. Redescriptions generated during the expansion will be appended to the list of redescriptions in the ``Expansions`` tab.
