   This webpage summarizes information about the demonstration of the *Siren* interactive interface for redescription mining to be presented at the `2014 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, Snowbird, Utah, USA on June 22-27, 2014 <http://sigmod2014.org>`_.

   More details can be found on the main *Siren* `webpage <http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/galbrun/redescriptors/siren/main/>`_ or in the `user guide <http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/galbrun/redescriptors/siren/help/>`_.


Redescription mining is a powerful data analysis tool that aims at finding alternative descriptions of the same entities.
 
For example, in biology, an important task is to identify the bioclimatic constraints that allow some species to survive, that is, to describe geographical regions in terms of both their bioclimatic conditions and the fauna that inhabit them.

*Siren* is a tool for interactive mining and visualization of redescriptions. It is based on the ReReMi mining algorithm.
