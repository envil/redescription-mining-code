<h2>Use-cases</h2>

<h3><a name="uc_bio"></a>Biological niche-finding</h3>

<div class="page-header">
<p>The first use-cases concerns niche-finding, i.e. the problem of finding species' bioclimatic envelope, an important task in biology.
</p>
</div>


<h4>Data</h4>
<p>
The Bio data describes spatial areas of Europe, 2575 squares of side 
roughly 50 kilometers. The left hand side data contains information 
about the mammals that live in these areas denoted with the names of the
 respective species. The minimum, maximum and average monthly 
temperatures in degrees Celsius as well as average monthly precipitation
 in millimeters, make up the right hand side data, denoted as t<sup>+</sup><sub>X</sub>, t<sup>-</sup><sub>X</sub>, t<sup>=</sup><sub>X</sub> and p<sup>=</sup><sub>X</sub>, respectively, where X is the number of the month.
The data comes from two publicly available datasets: European Mammals atlas and Worldclim climate data.

<h4>Exploration</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double click a variable to show it in a Map window.

</li>

<li>If you whish not to use some of the variables in this expansion, 
disable them by unchecking the corresponding box in the variables list 
of the Tools window.

</li>

<li>For example, let's use only monthly average temperature and rainfall, disabling monthly minimum and maximum temperatures.

</li>

<li>Start the expansion by clicking the expand button in the Map window. 
The best extensions mined are appended to the expansion list in the tool
 panel.

</li>

<li>Expansion is done. Let's have a closer look at some result.
<img src="siren_files/siren_map_rajapaja_02.jpg">
</li>

<li>
The results can be opened in different Map windows to be compared, by 
choosing "View in new window" in the contextual menu. For example with 
an extension from "Southwestern water vole".

</li>

<li>
The list of results can be sorted and filtered. Given a redescription of
 interest, click filter redundant in the contextual menu to disable all 
redundant redescriptions, i.e. redescription having too much overlap 
with it.

</li>

<li>
A list of edited redescriptions is maintained. It allows to keep an 
history of modifications and to undo changes, making edition safe.

<h3><a name="uc_us"></a>US census and election funds</h3>

<div class="page-header">
<p>This use-cases presents an hypothetical exploration of US census data.
</p>
</div>

<h4>Data</h4>
<p>
The US data describes the counties of continental United-States. The 
left hand side data contains socio-economic statistical indicators about
 these areas, see details <a href="http://www.fedstats.gov/qf/download/DataDict.txt">here</a>.
 The right hand side consists of data about funding of the electoral 
campaigns in 2006, 2008 and 2010, the total funds, percentage allotted 
to republican and to democratic party, respectively.
The data has been gathered from two public websites: <a href="http://www.fedstats.gov/">FedStats</a> and <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/elections/">Open Secrets</a>.
</p>

<h4>Exploration</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double click a redescription to open it in a Map window.

</li>

<li>Edit the redescription.

<li>If you wish not to use some of the variables in this expansion, for 
example variables used in the previous redescription, disable them by 
unchecking the corresponding box in the variables list in the tool 
panel.

<li>Expansion is done. The list of results can be sorted and filtered. 
Given a redescription of interest, click filter redundant in the 
contextual menu to disable all redundant redescriptions, i.e.
