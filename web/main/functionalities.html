<h2><a name="functionalities"></a>Functionalities</h2> 

<div class="page-header">
<p>Using <em>Siren</em>, a user can explore data of his
  interest by visualizing geospatial redescriptions on a map,
  interactively edit, expand and filter them.
</p>
</div>

<p>The main functionalities of <em>Siren</em> include:
<ul>
<li><em>Displaying a geospatial redescription on a map.</em>
Spatial redescriptions can be displayed on a map to show the locations 
where both queries hold (purple squares), only the left hand side query 
holds (blue squares) and only the right hand side query holds (red 
squares). 
</li>

<li><em>Editing a redescription.</em>
Existing redescriptions can be edited and the map and statistics will be
 recomputed and changes reflected in the original redescription in the 
list. It is also possible to build a new redescription from scratch.
</li>

<li><em>Expanding a redescription.</em> 
An existing or an edited redescription can be extended, all best extensions are appended to the expansion list.
</li>

<li><em>Mining redescriptions.</em>
Starting from an empty redescription, mines for redescriptions. 
The expansion list is updated after extending each initial pair
with the filtered list of redescriptions found so far.
</li>

<li><em>Selection of a subset of variables.</em> 
It is possible to select a subset of variables for use in mining/expanding, by disabling some variables.
</li>

<li><em>Filtering a redescription list.</em>
For a chosen redescription in a list, filter redundant redescriptions 
among those 
found below it, i.e., redescriptions having overlap with the chosen 
redescription in the left or right query over a chosen threshold. 
</li>

<li><em>History list.</em>
A concealable history tab keeps track of edited redescriptions, allowing to undo modifications. 
</li>
</ul>
