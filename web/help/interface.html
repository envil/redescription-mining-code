<h4><a name="tools_window"></a>Tools window</h4>
<p>The Tools window is unique, it is the main siren window. It contains several tabs.
</p>

<img src="../commons/top_tools.jpg">

<p>
Two tabs contain lists of variables. 
<ul>
<li>The <h5>LHS Variables</h5> tab,</li>
<li>and the <h5>RHS Variables</h5> tab contain the list of left-hand side variables and right-hand side variables respectively.</li>
</ul>

Three tabs contain lists of redescriptions. 
<ul>
<li>The <h5>Redescriptions</h5> tab is the main list of redescriptions. Redescriptions are imported and exported to and from that list.</li>
<li>The <h5>Expansions</h5> tab lists redescriptions that have been generated by mining or extending queries.</li>
<li>The <h5>History</h5> tab lists all edits made to queries, allowing to undo changes.</li>
</ul>

Finally, 
<ul>
<li>the <h5>Log</h5> tab contains logging output generated by the mining algorithm.</li>
</ul>
Tabs can be shown or hidden via the interface menu View.
</p>

<p>
The main means to manipulate variables or redescriptions, depending on which tab you are currently viewing, are available via the Edit menu and the contextual menu opened by right click. 
</p>

<p>
List items can be enabled/disabled by checking/unchecking the corresponding box in the left column. All items in a list can be enabled/disabled simultaneously.
Lists can be sorted based on the value of the different fields displayed by clicking on the column header.
</p>

<p>Redescriptions can cut, copied, and paste from and to different positions in the lists and from one list to the other and vice-versa.
All disabled redescritions can be deleted at once.
</p>


<h4><a name="map_window"></a>Map window</h4>
<p>A Map window allows to visualize a redescription, to edit it and launch mining and expansion. Several Map windows can be opened simultaneously with different redescriptions.
</p>

<p>A Map window can be opened with a double click on a variable or redescription in a list from the Tools window.
Edits made to a redescription will be reflected to the item in the list.
</p>

<p><a href="formats.html#statistics">Statistics of the redescriptions</a> are shown below the map. 
</p>

<img src="../commons/bottom_map.jpg">

<p>Both queries can be edited using the text boxes. If the <a href="formats.html#queries">syntax of a query</a> is incorrect, <em>Siren</em> will not be able to parse it and it will fall back on the previous correct query.
Queries are parsed when ENTER is pressed, in order to avoid parsing error due to partial edits. 
</p>

<p>Expansion can be started by pressing the <em>expand</em> button. The expansion will be delegated to a background task. It can be interrupted via the interface menu Tools, where running task are listed. Redescriptions generated during the expansion will be appended to the list of redescriptions in the Expansion tab.
